# Hello
I'm Clarence. I'm a software engineer from Penang, Malaysia, and currently based in Melbourne, Australia.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Software Engineering from Monash University in 2020. Despite that, I have been largely self-taught for most of my life.

## Works
I have been actively developing a wide variety of applications and tools across multiple platforms. You can read more about them on [my website](https://csiew.github.io/projects.html).
