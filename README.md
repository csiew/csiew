# Hello
I'm Clarence. I'm a software engineer from Penang, Malaysia, and currently based in Melbourne, Australia.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Software Engineering from Monash University in 2020. I have been largely self-taught for most of my life and believe that, sometimes, you just learn things *better* yourself.

## Works
I have been actively developing a wide variety of applications and tools across multiple platforms. You can read more about them on [my website](https://csiew.github.io/) or by exploring my repositories.
